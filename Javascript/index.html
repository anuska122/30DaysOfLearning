        <div id="section" class="item">JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript, most interactive computer and mobile device features, such as media or games, wouldn't function properly.</div>
        <div id="side" class="item">Understanding JavaScript is an important qualification for many computer scientists and web developers because it's the basis of interactive user interfaces on the web. JavaScript is a multipurpose programming language used to create web applications, game development and graphics. Brendan Eich developed the object-oriented, general-purpose language. Once Java applications are compiled, they result in a bytecode that can execute on any platform with the JavaScript engine. Because of this, JavaScript is what's known as a WORA ( write once, run anywhere) programming language.</div>
