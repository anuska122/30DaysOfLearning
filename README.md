### Animations and Keyframes
- An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. We can change as many CSS properties we want, as many times as we want. The keyframes controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence. This gives more control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence.

## Day13
## Variables, Datatype and Operators in JavaScript
### Variables

- JavaScript Variables are the building blocks of any programming language. In JavaScript, variables can be used to store reusable values. In JavaScript, a variable can be declared using var, let, const keywords.
  -  var keyword is used to declare variables since JavaScript was created. It is confusing and error-prone when using variables declared using var.
  - let keyword removes the confusion and error of var. It is the new and recommended way of declaring variables in JavaScript.
  - const keyword is used to declare a constant variable that cannot be changed once assigned a value.

### Datatypes
- In JavaScript, a data type is a classification of values that determines the possible operations that can be performed on those values and the way they are stored in memory.
  - I have presented types of datatypes in following image,

### Operators
- JavaScript operators operate the operands, these are symbols that are used to manipulate a certain value or operand. Operators are used to performing specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.
  - Types of operators:

### So, here are some samples of how I used the operators and variables.

## Day14

### Strings and its functions

- A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging. We can create them by wrapping the text inside single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. Template literals enable us to write cleaner code thanks to string interpolation, and when we need multi-line strings.
  - In the image below there are JavaScript string methods:

  And in the following image I have used some of the strings method of JavaScript,
