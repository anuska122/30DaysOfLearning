## Day1
## Forms

- The Form element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc. An HTML form is used to collect user input. An HTML form facilitates the user to enter data that is to be sent to the server for processing such as name, email address, password, phone number, etc.

## Day3
## CSS Box Modelling, Margin and Padding

- In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. In CSS, margin property sets or returns the margins of an element while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.

## Day5
### Creating a website using  Before and After pseudo selectors and Navigation Bar.

-  A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. The CSS :before and :after properties are what also known as pseudo elements. They are used to add something before or after the content of an element. There are a lot of great uses for these pseudo elements, and we are here to explore some of them.
-  Today I have also learn about the opacity. The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element. The opacity-level describes the transparency-level of the content.

## Day7
### CSS Flexbox

- The flexbox in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to control their alignment structure i.e, it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items. Flexbox is a useful tool for creating beautiful and responsive layouts for web pages.

## Day8
### CSS Grid 
- The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. CSS Grid gives us the tools to create basic and advanced website layouts in responsive way.

## Day9
### Creating Layouts using Grid Template Area

 - The grid-template-areas property specifies areas within the grid layout. It allows us to create a visual representation of our layout by assigning names to different regions of the grid and then placing grid items into those areas based on the defined names.

## Day10
### Visibility in CSS
- The visibility CSS property shows or hides an element without changing the layout of a document. Visibility property specifies how an element should be displayed.

### z-index in CSS
- z-index is the CSS property that controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a page. An element with a higher z-index value will appear in front of an element with a lower z-index value.

## Day11
### Animations and Keyframes
- An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. We can change as many CSS properties we want, as many times as we want. The keyframes controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence. This gives more control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence.

## Day12

## Day13
## Variables, Datatype and Operators in JavaScript
### Variables

- JavaScript Variables are the building blocks of any programming language. In JavaScript, variables can be used to store reusable values. In JavaScript, a variable can be declared using var, let, const keywords.
  -  var keyword is used to declare variables since JavaScript was created. It is confusing and error-prone when using variables declared using var.
  - let keyword removes the confusion and error of var. It is the new and recommended way of declaring variables in JavaScript.
  - const keyword is used to declare a constant variable that cannot be changed once assigned a value.

### Datatypes
- In JavaScript, a data type is a classification of values that determines the possible operations that can be performed on those values and the way they are stored in memory.
  - I have presented types of datatypes in following image,

### Operators
- JavaScript operators operate the operands, these are symbols that are used to manipulate a certain value or operand. Operators are used to performing specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.
  - Types of operators:

### So, here are some samples of how I used the operators and variables.

## Day14

### Strings and its functions

- A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging. We can create them by wrapping the text inside single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. Template literals enable us to write cleaner code thanks to string interpolation, and when we need multi-line strings.
  - In the image below there are JavaScript string methods:
 
  ![](https://github.com/anuska122/30DaysOfLearning/assets/154875734/26c2f1f4-e394-4040-8419-3d3b0905eae4)

  And in the following image I have used some of the strings method of JavaScript,

  ## Day15
  ### Arrays and Objects
  - An array in JavaScript is a type of global object that is used to store data. Arrays consist of an ordered collection or list containing zero or more data types, and use numbered indices starting from zero to access specific items. Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data rather than just a single value.

## Day16
### Functions in JavaScript

- In JavaScript, a function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks. Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript and play a crucial role in organizing and structuring code. Some Functions are,
  - Alert: Display a popup box with the specified message with the OK button.

  - Confirm: Display a popup box with the specified message with OK and Cancel buttons.
 
  - ![](https://github.com/anuska122/30DaysOfLearning/assets/154875734/36568522-296f-48e6-9169-2dbdf0819f1b)

  - Prompt: Display a popup box to take the user's input with the OK and Cancel buttons.

## Day17
### Loops in JavaScript
- Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.

  JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
  - for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
  - for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
  - for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
  - while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
  - do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

## Day18
### Events in JavaScript
- An event is an action that occurs as per the user's instruction as input and gives the output in response. We can consider different types of inputs, such as mouse clicks, button presses, and when users press tab and text box change.

## Day 19
### Creating a Digital Clock using the Setinterval function of Javascript
- SetInterval is a function in JavaScript is used to repeatedly execute a given function at a specified interval. It takes two arguments, the first argument is the function to be executed and the second argument is the time interval (in milliseconds) between each execution.

## Day20
### Math Object In JavaScript
- The math object provides us properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Unlike other global objects, Math is not a constructor. All the properties and methods of Math are static and can be called by using Math as an object without creating it.
